# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 4
Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed sentiment analysis on social media data to uncover patterns in public opinion and emotional responses toward specific entities or topics.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset from Kaggle. It includes tweets labeled with sentiment scores related to different entities, making it ideal for sentiment pattern exploration.

Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, Numpy

NLTK / TextBlob / Vader for sentiment analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

WordCloud for textual insights

Sentiment Analysis Process

**Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps I followed:**

Text Preprocessing: Cleaned the tweet texts by removing punctuation, stopwords, URLs, and special characters.

Sentiment Scoring: Used NLP libraries to assign sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) to each tweet.

Visualization: Plotted sentiment distribution, most common words using WordClouds, and trends across different entities.


# Conclusion

This analysis provided a deeper understanding of public sentiment on social media and how entities are perceived. Such insights are essential for brand monitoring, campaign effectiveness, and opinion mining in real-world applications.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
